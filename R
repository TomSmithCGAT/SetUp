Initial R set up using conda (see ./Conda)
Downloaded Rstudio then:
sudo rpm -Uvh rstudio-1.0.136-x86_64.rpm
To install rstudio in /usr/bin

Rstudio is using the correct R from conda:
/home/FILESERVER5/proteomics/tss38/anaconda3/bin/R
(3.3.2)

Issues with rendering text (see ./General 28 JAN 17).
Tried resolving by installing fonts. Eeventually removed R and rstudio:

> conda list|grep 'r-' |cut -f1 -d' '|xargs conda uninstall

> rm -rf /usr/bin/rstudio

Then reinstall R with conda:

> conda install -c r r-essentials

Now plotting works fine

NOTE (31 JAN 17):
The plotting issue resurfaced. Looks like the issue may relate to the conda r-base=3.3.1 build.
Best resolved by upgrading r-base to 3.3.2

> conda install r-base-3.3.2

Need to monitor issue to ensure it only relates to this precise conda build
